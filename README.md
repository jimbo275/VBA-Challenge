# VBA-Challenge

**Objective**
A simple VBA script that loops through a list stocks in a single year and outputs:
- Ticker symbols
- The yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- The percentage from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- Total volume of the stock

**Output**
In the final output, I highlighted positive stock changes in green, negative changes in red.
